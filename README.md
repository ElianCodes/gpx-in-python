# gpx-in-python

This a descriptive jupyter notebook on how to work with gpxfiles using the gpxpy library in Python

The notebook file is located in `./project.ipynb` and the testdata in the `./sampleData` folder

The notebook file is a little to big for Hithub to display, so it's better you download the file or repository.

- [anaconda](<https://www.anaconda.com>)
- [Jupyter Notebook](<https://jupyter.org/>) (comes with Anaconda)
